## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Kaggleâ€™s third annual survey 2019 to better understand:

Question 1: What the dominated gender in data science and what is the highest age ratio?

Question 2: What the most compensation the data scientists can get?

Question 3: What media sources data scienticts get the information from?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

multiple_choice_responses.csv - This file contains 19,718 observations about Kaggle members' respondents in the survey, it contains different kinds of variables either numerical or categorical. It contains missing values.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@fahadeid/what-media-sources-data-scientists-using-the-most-analysis-of-the-2019-kaggle-ml-ds-survey-22e01c11b9f3).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
